  About This Program

This program provides a colorized version of xxd(1), assigning colors
to byte values found in the input, thus making it easier to see
patterns of repeated values.

The source code also provides a very simple example of using the
tinfo library to inject control codes into standard output, without
having to conform to curses's presentation-based API.

  Building and Installing

To build, simply run "make". The resulting executable runs standalone.
If you wish to install the program to a shared location, just use
