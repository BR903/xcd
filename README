  About This Program

This program provides a colorized version of xxd(1), assigning colors
to byte values found in the input, thus making it easier to see
patterns of repeated values.

The source code also provides a very simple example of using the
tinfo library to inject control codes into standard output, without
having to conform to curses's presentation-based API.

In order to colorize its output, this program needs to be run on a
terminal capable of displaying 256 colors. Because there is no
portable way of querying the color palette, the program assumes that
the terminal's palette matches the standard palette of xterm-256color.

(If xcd claims that your terminal does not have 256 colors, try
setting the TERM environment variable to "xterm-256color". If the
resulting output is garbled, then try using it with a different
terminal.)

  Building and Installing

There is no configure script. To build, simply run "make". The
existing executable runs standalone. To install, run "make install".
By default the makefile installs xcd under /usr/local, but you can
override this by change the value of the PREFIX variable.
